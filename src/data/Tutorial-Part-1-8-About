Tutorial
You are doing very well! Next thing is the menu on the
left hand side of the screen. Just click at the first
button to see what the menu contains.

Here you are able to see the exact value of the straight
line, samples you added and even an error of the linear
regression, which tells how far all points are from the line.

There are also some buttons that are responsible for visibility of
some features like coordinate system grid or graphical interpretation
of the error! Check them out. Be careful with the "menu" button though,
since it will take you back to the main menu.

About button will show/hide the information about current visualization.
You can press it twice to hide and show again this message box.

The great thing about the menu is ability to move the samples using
keyboard. When you test all buttons you should check that out as well.

To move the sample using the keyboard - press the left mouse button
when the mouse will be above the button related to the sample you wish
to move. If you don't know which button it is, you can hover the mouse
over the button and see that around one sample there is an orange
ring. You can do it another way - move the mouse over the point you wish to
move and corresponding button will light up.

Your task is to move samples that they will have these coordinates:
(-1.5, 1.5), (-0.5, 2.5), (0.5, 3.5). Don't worry about the order.
You just need to have three samples with these values. Can you do it
using your keyboard?
