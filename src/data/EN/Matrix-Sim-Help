2x2 Matrix Simulation
Welcome to 2x2 Matrix Simulation.

To add new point press the right mouse button at chosen place.
To move a point to a different place hold left mouse button and move the point to chosen place.
To delete a point press right mouse button on the point you wish to delete.
The default color of every point is blue.
In order to make the simulation more clear you can change the colour of every point.
To change the color of the point move the mouse over chosen point
and press number between 1 and 6.
For mor information please check out the "First steps" available in the main menu.

The matrix consists of two vectors: red and green.
You can change the values of them, pressing the left mouse button and move the vector to the different place.
Initial values of vectors are (1,0) and (0,1).
Additionally the simulation draws a grid that shows how the matrix space looks like.

The determinant of the matrix is represented by a parallelogram spanning the
bases of that matrix. Its area is the absolute value of the determinant of that matrix.
The exact value of the determinant is displayed in the
side menu on the left side of the screen under the matrix values.

Transposition and inverse of this matrix are represented by another matrices.
Color of basis of the transpose is blue and color of the inverse matrix is yellow.

Eigenvectors if exist are drawn as straight white lines. However if the eigenvalues are
not real eigenvectors are not drawn at all. Eigenvalues are displayed below the determinant.

Projected vectors are the outcome of the multiplication of the matrix and vectors added by the user.

If the matrix is almost singular, the simulation does not draw
the matrix grid because the number of lines goes to infinity and
this can slow down the entire program considerably.
