Tutorial
Look at these numbers! Now you can be very precise.
Right so you know how to zoom out/in, move the camera,
add, remove and move points (using mouse or keyboard).
You also know where to look if you're looking for some
numbers related to the current simulation
or buttons to unlock new visual effects.
But it is not the end.

For prediction algorithms the most important thing is
the class of the sample. We need to distinguish which
sample belongs to which class so we need to change their colors.

But before we do so let's first remove all samples. If you forgot
you have to press right mouse button on the sample that you wish
to delete.
