Tutorial
Even one iteration is enough to find pretty good line.
You can play with it a little bit longer in the visualization
of logistic regression. Check out the others simulation as well.
And if you want to learn how these algorithms work, you need
to check the theory section.

This is end of the tutorial. You know how to use simulation
properly.
If you will have some troubles you can always press
"Help" button and read some basic information about
the current running simulation. Have a good time with those!
