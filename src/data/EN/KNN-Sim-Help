K Nearest Neighbours
Welcome to KNN Simulation.

To add new point press the right mouse button at chosen place.
To move a point to a different place hold left mouse button and move the point to chosen place.
To delete a point press right mouse button on the point you wish to delete.
The default color of every point is gray, meaning that this point is a test sample (not the training one).
To change the color of the point and also the class of the sample move the mouse over chosen point
and press number between 1 and 6. To make the point neutral again press the 0 button with the mouse over the point.
The predicted color of the neutral point is representing by the small circle inside the point.
For mor information please check out the "First steps" available in the main menu.

The user interface of KNN has two elements - connections and rings.
Connections symbolize distances between neutral point and nearest training points (neighbours).
The connection to the furthest neighbour makes a ring, showing the area contains all neighbours of this neutral point.
Those training samples in the area make the prediction of the neutral sample using voting.
The color of the ring is the same as the predicted color.

This algorithm has one hyperparameter k, indicates how many nearest neighbours take part in voting.
You can change the value of k from 1 to 10 using the slider on the left side of the screen.

If it's impossible to decide the vote (a few class on the first place), algorithm decreases the k value by one,
which means that it deletes the farthest neighbour and then it votes again.
