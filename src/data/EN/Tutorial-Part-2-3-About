Tutorial
We have complete training dataset.
Now we can check whether the new point should be red, or the algorithm tells that
it should be blue. Please, add two more points in those yellow square (one per square).
To add the point use the right mouse button.

For points that are laying on the same side of the line that red points, the algorithm
will tell you that their color should be red as well, however if some points will be on the
same side as blue points - blue color will be predicted for them. Only for gray points
the algorithm predicts the color.
