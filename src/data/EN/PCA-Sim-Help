Principal Component Analysis
Welcome to the PCA algorithm simulation.

To add new point press the right mouse button at chosen place.
To move a point to a different place hold left mouse button and move the point to chosen place.
To delete a point press right mouse button on the point you wish to delete.
The default color of every point is blue.
In order to make the simulation more clear you can change the colour of every point.
To change the color of the point move the mouse over chosen point
and press number between 1 and 6.
For mor information please check out the "First steps" available in the main menu.

Using added by the user points, the algorithm computes the covariance matrix, which is representing
by two vectors: red and green.
The eigenvectors of this matrix has color that has contrast to the background color (white or black).
and they are multiply by corresponding eigenvalues.

Because this is the reduction from 2D to 1D, all points are projected to only one eigenvector
(according to the PCA algorithm rules - this with the highest eigenvalue).
Projected points have only one coordinate so they are drawn onto X axis.

Using this algorithm makes sense only if there are three points that are not laying on the same line.
