Linear Regression
Welcome to 2x2 Matrix Simulation.

To add new point press the right mouse button at chosen place.
To move a point to a different place hold left mouse button and move the point to chosen place.
To delete a point press right mouse button on the point you wish to delete.
The default color of every point is blue.
In order to make the simulation more clear you can change the colour of every point.
To change the color of the point move the mouse over chosen point
and press number between 1 and 6.
For mor information please check out the "First steps" available in the main menu.

The regression line is that green line that tries to fit all added points the best as possible.
Its exact formula is printed on the left hand side of the screen.

The SSE (sum of squared errors) is represented by red squares.
The sum of the areas of all squares is the regression error.
