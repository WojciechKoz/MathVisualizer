Tutorial
As you can see, the side menu has changed. Now we are no
longer in linear regression, but in logistic regression simulation.
It sounds similar, but it's a completely different algorithm.
This time the simulation tries to find the best line that
separates all blue samples from the red ones. Again you don't have
to know how it works, you are just learning how to use it.

You can see that there are four point in the coordinate system.
Let's color them red and later we will add some blue points and
check if line separates them.

To change the color of the sample you have to keep the mouse over this
point and press 0-6 buttons on the keyboard which are responsible for
coloring samples. To color these points red you should press the '2' button.

BTW for now those points are gray (0 button) and it means that they are not visible
for the line, so they don't have any impact on the algorithm,
