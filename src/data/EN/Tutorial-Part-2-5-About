Since the neutral sample does not participate in finding
the separation line, when you moved it the line stayed
the same. What did change though is the predicted color
of that neutral sample - now it's red.

As you may have seen, a new button type has appeared in the menu.
It is a slider and it is very useful when some algorithms have
a constant values which can be different for various instances
of the same algorithm. For example the most useful constants in
logistic regression are eta and epochs amount. Eta is a size of
a step in the stochastic gradient descent algorithm and epochs
is a number how many iterations algorithm need to do. Not going
into it, let's change the epochs value to 1 to
see if one iteration will be enough to find a reasonable line.

The usage is very simple - just drag the mouse to the left side of
the slider. You can also click in the place you wish to have a slider
but it is less precise way. The simulation will change automatically.

Do not change the ETA slider or if you done it just set it to
value 0.59 or higher.
