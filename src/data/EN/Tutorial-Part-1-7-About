Tutorial
Right, let's focus on something other than adding and removing points.
Now we will check how to move the existing sample.
This is very useful if you want to see how this sample affects the simulation.
The simulation updates every time the sample moves so you get the feeling
that the simulation is "live".

Moving is also very easy - just click on the sample you want to select
then keep the button pressed and drag the mouse. The sample will follow the mouse.

Let's move the first sample to the yellow area.
So the linear regression algorithm will fit to the
points very well since all of them will almost lie on the straight line.
