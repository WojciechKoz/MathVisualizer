Tutorial
Let's move the new gray point which is in the
blue area to the red area. There is no specified
square where the point must go, but it has to be
above the yellow line to change its predicted class.
When the sample will cross the line you should see
that the small circle inside the sample will change
the color.

To move the sample click on it, keep the button
pressed and drag the mouse.
The sample will follow the mouse.
