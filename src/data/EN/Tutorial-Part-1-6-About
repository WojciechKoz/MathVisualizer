Now we can see all the samples at once. However, this isolated
point spoils everything. The line tries to fit to every point,
but this last point seems to have the greatest effect on the line.
Moreover, this point may be wrong, looking at other samples.
I think we should delete this point. Deleting is very
easy and similar to adding points. In fact, you also need to press
the right mouse button. This time though you have to click on the
sample you want to delete instead of the void.

Delete the point indicated by the arrows.
Don't worry if you miss that point. Adding points is currently disabled
so nothing will happen.
