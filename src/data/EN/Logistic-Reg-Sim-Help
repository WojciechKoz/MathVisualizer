Logistic Regression
Welcome to the simulation of logistic regression.

To add new point press the right mouse button at chosen place.
To move a point to a different place hold left mouse button and move the point to chosen place.
To delete a point press right mouse button on the point you wish to delete.
The default color of every point is gray, meaning that this point is a test sample (not the training one).
To change the color of the point and also the class of the sample move the mouse over chosen point
and press number between 1 and 6. To make the point neutral again press the 0 button with the mouse over the point.
The predicted color of the neutral point is representing by the small circle inside the point.
For mor information please check out the "First steps" available in the main menu.

Temporarily the algorithm handles only two colors of samples: red and blue.
The line separating red points from blue points is calculated using
stochastic gradient descent algorithm (with batch size equals to 1).

The step size (ETA) and number of iterations (Epochs) are the hyperparameters
of the model and they can be changed at the left side of the screen.
The output of the algorithm is a 2-dimensional vector [wx, wy] and bias value.
Their exact values are printed at the left hand side of the screen with the coefficients
of the separating line.

Red points mean positive samples and blue - negative, meaning that
the dot product of the weight vector and some point plus the bias is greater than
0 indicates that the point should be red, otherwise blue.

Before the line is computed all samples are centering to (0,0) point by subtracting
the mean value of samples of each sample.
Then the algorithm is far more stable and the parameters are calculated more precisely.
At the end the line is shifted by the old mean value and all samples are moved back to
the previous place, so it's not visible in the simulation.
