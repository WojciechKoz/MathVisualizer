Tutorial
Welcome to the tutorial. Here you will find out how to use simulations
that are available in this application. Although you won't learn
any theory standing behind simulated algorithms in this tutorial,
You will understand how to use them correctly. Don't worry if you won't
be able to remember everything, you can always come back here
and remember the basics. Please, follow the instructions and arrows in the screen.
And remember that sometimes you will have to scroll to see all content
in this window.
Let's start!

This is simulation of linear regression. You don't have to know what it is, but
in one word, it is a line that fits given points as best as it can.
To see how it looks like we have to obviously add some points.
To do that you need to press the right button of the mouse somewhere
on the coordinate system. Please do it inside the yellow square in the
middle of the screen.
