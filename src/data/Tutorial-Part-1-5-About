Tutorial
Finally we added the last point. But look at that!
We are not able to see the line and all the samples at
the same time. Sometimes its better to zoom out rather than
move the camera. Let's see how all points look like.

To zoom out you have to scroll the mouse wheel towards you.
Keep scrolling until you will be able to see all points
and the message will change. Remember that the mouse cannot
be inside this message window, because it means that you want
to scroll the text.

While scrolling, your mouse position moves slightly the
camera. The effect is similar to google maps scrolling.
Hopefully this will be intuitive for you.

TIP: If you want to see what is below te screen when zooming
out, it's better to have the mouse at the top of the screen.
But when you want to zoom in, the camera will move towards the
mouse position.
