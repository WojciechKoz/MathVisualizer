As you can see, the side menu has changed. Now we are no
longer in linear regression, but in logistic regression simulation.
It sounds similar, but it's a completely different algorithm.
This time the simulation tries to find the best line that
separates all blue samples from the red ones. Again you don't have
to know how it works, but there is a quick note why this algorithm
is useful.

Imagine that you have some cherry and hazel leaves. You want to
have an algorithm that is able to distinguish one leaves from another.
You can measure their height and width and each leaf will be a point
where its x-coordinate is its width and y-coordinate is the height.
Now you can plot all leaves on the coordinate system but you need to
still be able to distinguish which leaf is from cherry and which from hazel.
Therefore, you should color them with different colors.
For example, cherry leaves will be red and hazel will be blue.

Now you should be able to see in which area of the coordinate
system cherry leaves are more common than elsewhere. But you can also
use the logistic regression algorithm and you will have the formula for
cherry leaves and hazel leaves.

You can see that there are four point in the coordinate system.
These points are a logical interpretation of the dimensions of the
cherry leaves. Before we add hazel leaves we should first color them.

To change the color of the sample you have to keep the mouse over this
point and press 0-6 buttons on the keyboard which are responsible for
coloring samples. To color these points red you should press the '2' button.
I bet you won't have any problems with that.
