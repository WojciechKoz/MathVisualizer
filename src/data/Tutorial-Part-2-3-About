Tutorial
We have complete training dataset.
Now we can check whether the new (unknown)
leaf is a cherry or hazel leaf. You know how to
add new samples but if you forgot - you need to
press right mouse button somewhere in the
coordinate system. Please add two samples
one in each yellow square.

You should see that in both gray (neutral) samples
there are small circles. It is predicted color of this
sample. So if one sample has red circle inside it is more
likely that this sample is a cherry leaf.
