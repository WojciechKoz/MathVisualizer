Tutorial
Great! Take a look at the side menu - the colors of the
samples have changed there too. There are also four new
samples of hazel leaves. You should color them blue.
To use blue ink, press "1" instead of "2". Be careful
and color only the gray samples. When the first blue
sample appears, you will be able to see the line
separating the two types of leaves.

In case you made a mistake and you don't know which samples
should be red and which ones should be blue.
The first four in the menu should be red and the next four - blue.
