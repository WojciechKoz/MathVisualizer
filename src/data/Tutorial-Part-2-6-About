Tutorial
Wow even one iteration is enough to find pretty good line.
Logistic regression algorithm is indeed very powerful!
You can play with it a little bit longer in the visualization
of logistic regression. Check out the others simulation as well.
And if you want to learn how these algorithms work, you need
to check the theory section.

This is end of the tutorial. You know how to use simulation
properly. There are some other things line matrices but
I bet you will find out how to use them with no effort.
However if you will have some troubles you can always press
"About" button and read some basic information about
the current running simulation. Have a good time with those!

Click Menu button to leave the simulation.
