Logistic Regression
This is a logistic regression simulation.
The algorithm tries to find the best straight line that 
separates the blue and red samples. You can add the sample 
by pressing the right mouse button somewhere in the cartesian plane. 

At the beginning the sample will be gray meaning that it is neutral.
Neutral samples do not have an impact on the line but 
depending on which side of the line it lies - it has red or blue predicted color.
If you want to add a training sample that has an impact on the line,
you can color the existing sample by hovering the mouse over it and
press '1' button if you want to color it blue or '2' for the red color sample.
You must have at least one red sample and one blue sample for the line to be drawn.

You can add more samples or move the existing ones 
and the line will always try to separate them as good as possible.
If the points cannot be separated with a straight line, 
the result may not be satisfactory and perhaps you are looking for 
some non linear algorithm or you need to add some kernel function. 
Unforunately kernel functions are not yet available in this app.

The line is calculated using "stochastic gradient descent" algorithm 
(with batch size equals to 1). 
The step size (ETA) and number of iteration over the samples (Epochs) 
are changeble using the sliders on the left side of the screen since these are hyperparameters.
The result is a weights vector and the bias. If the dot product 
of the weights and new sample + the bias is greater than 0 - the sample 
is positive (red) otherwise is negative (blue). The separation line is 
pretty straightforward to calculate. 

Before the line is computed all samples are centering to (0,0) point by subtracting 
the mean value of samples of each sample. 
Then the algorithm is far more stable and the parameters are calculated more precisely. 
At the end the line is shifted by the old mean value and all samples are moved back to 
the previous place.
