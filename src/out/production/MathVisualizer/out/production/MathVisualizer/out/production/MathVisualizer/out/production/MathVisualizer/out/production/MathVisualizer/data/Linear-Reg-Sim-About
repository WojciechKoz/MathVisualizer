Linear Regression
This is a linear regression simulation - a straight line 
that fits all samples as good as possible.
You can add more samples by pressing the right 
mouse button somewhere in the cartesian plane.
The optimized function is the sum of the squared 
differences between the y coordinates of each sample 
and the y-value of the line at the x point of that sample.
The graphical interpretation of the error that we minimize 
is the set of red squares drawn between the points and the line.
The exact line value and error can be checked on the left side of the screen.

If you want to know how this line is calculated, 
please see Linear Regression Theory in Probability 
and Statistics section of this app.
