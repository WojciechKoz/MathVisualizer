Matrix Simulation
This is a 2x2 matrix simulation. Basis of the matrix are represented by two vectors (red and green).
You can change values of the matrix by moving the circles at the ends of the vectors with the mouse.
The exact values are displayed in the side menu on the left side of the screen.
Each vector you add will be multiplied by this matrix and the result will
be displayed in a slightly more transparent color.
The result is nothing more than the projection of this vector
onto the space created by this matrix
(for more details please check out theory of linear algebra available in this app).

The determinant of the matrix is represented by a parallelogram spanning the
bases of that matrix because its area is the absolute value of the determinant of that matrix.
The exact value of the determinant is displayed in the
side menu on the left side of the screen under the matrix values.

Transposition and inverse of this matrix are represented by another matrices.
Color of basis of the transpose is blue and color of the inverse matrix is yellow.
You can also check the values of inverse matrix looking at the side menu.

Eigenvectors if exist are drawn as straight white lines. However if the eigenvalues are
not real eigenvectors are not drawn at all. Eigenvalues are displayed below the determinant.

If the matrix is almost singular, the simulation does not draw
the matrix grid because the number of lines goes to infinity and
this can slow down the entire program considerably.
